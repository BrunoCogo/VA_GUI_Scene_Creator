# VA_GUI_Scene_Creator
First Post

Hello and thank you for checking out VA GUI - A Scene creator/editor for the game VA by I-Can't Write.

Even if the game is nishe, and the VA GUI program is on early development, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to check this small project out. 

This program is on early development and thus it will contain errors. As feedback comes in and errors are fixes, I'll be releseing future verisons on the future (hopefuly)

If you would like to contribute directly in the project, there are two ways to do so:
1.) Use the program and create your scenes as usual. If you see any undesared behaviour, please note down:
*your actions leading up to the behaviour.
*The Expected behaviour (as you where expecting)
*The resulting behaviour (wether there was a error message or an undetected wrong behaviour)
And post them on the Issues tab here with "[bug]" or "[UnBeh]" on the title

If you have an Idea on how to improve the experiance for the program, write you idea on the issues tab with "Idea" on the title

2.)If you wantt to contibute code for the project, download a copy of the source, branch it to your own branch and code what you want.
After you finish codeing it, make sure it works as intended and that it didn't broke the program as it already was.

Another ways to contribute with the project, although in an indirect way, would be donating one or two dollars using the donation botton on
top right corner. I don't want to sound like a beggar, but every little thing helps. The money would be used to help pay bills and other smaller
nessesities. This botton would open a paypal donation page on your web browser after asking for a confirmation.

While it's not implemented at the moment, I would plan to include a special thanks in the program where I would include the donators.
If you would like to donate even a small amount and would like to appear as a shoutout with a link to your page, please send me an email to 
BrunoCogo@outlook.com mentioning the time and amount of the dotaion together with the link of your page.

If you are a seasoned writer on Text adventures or on Vore stories, another important way in which you could contribute to the project is by
helping out setting up a "writing tips" for beginners that would help asparing scene writiers

And with that a closing statement: Be aware that some parts of the program might be confusing, I will elaborate a wiki page to help with the beggining steps,
but it will take time. 

Other than that, Enjoy creating!~
