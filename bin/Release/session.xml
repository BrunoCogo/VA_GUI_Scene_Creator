        <Description> At first glance, this is a normal bar... well, that is excluding that the bartender is a two-legged griffin, at least she seems like it with the bird-like features, blueish tone of the feathers and lion-like tail. There's also a lion on one of the tables, he is looking bored and quite down. You could go and talk to him. there's also a rat sit on the pod of the bottle, he looks weirdly each time the bartender looked at him. You could just sit, drink, and ignore everything else</Description>

The wolf is little more your size, maybe you can fight him.</Description>

He stops and says "OK, don't struggle...much. You won't be digested if you obey at least at the beginning." You where about to say something, but the wolf wolfs you down bit by bit, and fast. First your arms, next to your head, moving to the rest of your body. Your size was clearly no problem to the wolf for the easiness in which he glup you. You slided to your temporal prison. The stomach seems to be able to stretch a lot, however you are still squished to a position that leaves you almost immobile. The wolf flips so that his belly is upward and you are press against his back."Now, I'll lay here and you stay there, I'll realize you when I'm satisfy, so I'll recommend start moving or just relax inside this body." Now what?</Description>

After some preparation of the wolf, he sat upon your head and started to engulf it, he continue to put more of your body inside of him. The flesh, although stretchy, slided hardly around you. the wolf stops after his but cheeks where near to your leap. You could hear the wolf's heart bearing and some of the pleasure moans of the wolf. He then lift his but a few inches up only to drop it again. He continues to do so for no more than an hour. The wolf rest for a moment still siting on you with your legs still out. you move your torso in hope to get the attention of the wolf, "Calm down, I really doubt you are not enjoying this as much as I am." He proceeds to lift his ass up wards and then press your feet against the wall pushing you deeper. You get squirm by the intestines, curiously, for more that the intestines try to push you deeper, something is holding you in a way that you cannot advance or go back. "That's feels awesome, I love how the bulk gets formed, It's just too relaxing. See ya till noon" </Description>

Hey, yesterday was awesome, I need to do that more often. I'll realice you in a moment as promise." He moves outside the room, outside the hotel and goes behind a trash bin. He lift his back leg and starts pushing you upward. The wolf pushed a lot to get you out. When you came out, there was a pond of cum surrounding you.

"Hello there, my dear" She said, you responded "Do we know each other?" - "perhaps not in your lifetime, but I know you have meet me before. And here we are again. Are you gonna finish what I started?". As you tried to approach the door again, she shuts it forcefully with a magic spell. "Come on darling, what about if we discust this..." she stops as her eyes began to shine a rather attractive yellow, then resumes "is all about perspective isn't it?"     You start feeling weird... was the whole world that big before? oh... The fox says "Now little heart, are you still with me or what? no harm needs to be done." You could fight your way out of here but with the size of an ant its a great risk, plus if she gets you, there is not comming back.</Description>

You started screaming but she cover your mouth with her finger "You'll be safe, and you will be right back in a few hours." You slided across her birthing canal and finally arived to your destination. You are able to streach your body condidering the differences in sides. "Oh,yes! Now relax, sweatheart. The faster you sleep the faster you will get out." Seem like there is no escape, now you have to sleep around her jucies.</Description>

        <Description> You close your eyes hopeing that that fox keeps true to her word. After a sleep, you wake up still inside of her and this time, you are summerged in her jucies. The only thing that keeps you for drauning inside of here was a bubble surrounding your nose and mouth. You tried to push to the nearest thing to you. "Oh... my... my. You're quite the sleepyhead, are you? I never thought I could spend to much time with you. Did you enjoyed yourself this past 3 weeks." you where shocked that three weeks have pass even though you felt like you slept from night to morning. The fox started pushing. You feel yourself pushed along the canal, the more you where pushed to your liberty, the more your body grown inside the canal. After some efforts of the fox and a few pleasure moans, you where out. You open your eyes to discover you are infront of the city and the fox is nowhere to be seen. There is a writing on the ground made of the jucies of the fox, "see ya around, sweetheart )"</Description>
